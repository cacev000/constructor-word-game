## Instructions

The completed game should meet the following criteria:

1. The completed game should be able to receive user input using the `inquirer` or `prompt` npm packages.

2. Your solution should have, at minimum, three files:

* **Letter.js**: Contains a constructor, Letter. This constructor should be able to either display an underlying character or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. That means the constructor should define:

  * A string value to store the underlying character for the letter

  * A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet

  * A function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or a placeholder (like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed

  * A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly

* **Word.js**: Contains a constructor, Word that depends on the Letter constructor. This is used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess. That means the constructor should define:

  * An array of `new` Letter objects representing the letters of the underlying word

  * A function that returns a string representing the word. This should call the function on each letter object (the first function defined in `Letter.js`) that displays the character or an underscore and concatenate those together.

  * A function that takes a character as an argument and calls the guess function on each letter object (the second function defined in `Letter.js`)

* **index.js**: The file containing the logic for the course of the game, which depends on `Word.js` and:

  * Randomly selects a word and uses the `Word` constructor to store it

  * Prompts the user for each guess and keeps track of the user's remaining guesses

3. `Letter.js` *should not* `require` any other files.

4. `Word.js` *should only* require `Letter.js`

5. **HINT:** Write `Letter.js` first and test it on its own before moving on, then do the same thing with `Word.js`

6. **HINT:** If you name your letter's display function `toString`, JavaScript will call that function automatically whenever casting that object to a string (check out this example: <https://jsbin.com/facawetume/edit?js,console>)
